### Project Description

Rainy Odds is a thrilling web-based racing game where users can bet on realistically rendered, falling raindrops. It features a single-player mode and a local multiplayer mode for friends to compete against each other. It simulates real-life betting but with a fun twist of betting on raindrops falling.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Productivity is at an all-time high, but what happens when it rains? People get distracted watching raindrops race down windows. This agonizing, unmonetized suspense leads to billions in lost... fun. Humanity needs a way to formalize this natural pastime and add the thrill of losing imaginary money.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Rainy Odds provides a sophisticated, high-stakes platform for raindrop racing. By digitizing the windowpane, we allow users to bet on their favorite drops, compete against friends in local multiplayer, and immortalize their winnings on a prestigious leaderboard. And guess what's fun? It's completely useless and a waste of time. It's the pinnacle of useless, weather-based entertainment.
